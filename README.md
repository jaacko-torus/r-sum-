# My Résumé

I'm using [AltaCV](https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV) as my document class.

Additionally, GNU Make was driving me crazy, so I found a different build tool built with Rust called [just](https://github.com/casey/just). It looks just like any other `makefile` but it's more useful and better made.

Click [here](./main/document.pdf) the latest version. Click [here](./main/archive/Avar%20Campopiano,%20Julián%20-%20Résumé%20-%202022-02-16) for latest packaged version.

Since both the résumé and AltaCV have been edited from the original they are licensed under LPPL. No clue how it works.
